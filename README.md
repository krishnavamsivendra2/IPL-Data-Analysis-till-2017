🏏 IPL Data Analysis – Azure Data Engineering Project

This repository contains an end-to-end Data Engineering project on IPL (Indian Premier League) data, inspired by the work of Darshil Parmar (linkedin.com/in/darshil-parmar).

The original project architecture is implemented using AWS services.

In this project, I aim to rebuild and adapt the complete data pipeline using Microsoft Azure, focusing on cloud-native, scalable data engineering practices.

🔹 Project Objectives

    Ingest raw IPL datasets into Azure cloud storage
    Perform data cleaning, transformation, and modeling
    Build scalable data pipelines for analytics use cases
    Execute analytical queries to extract meaningful insights 
    Understand and compare AWS vs Azure data engineering services

🔹 Tech Stack (Planned)
    
    Cloud: Microsoft Azure
    Storage: Azure Blob Storage / Data Lake
    Data Processing: Azure Data Factory / Azure Databricks
    Analytics: Azure Synapse Analytics
    Language: Python, SQL

🔹 Project Status

🚧 In Progress – Work will be updated incrementally as the project evolves.
